              conclusion of submissions for the seasonal leaderboard is drawing
              near. Below, you'll find an overview of key statistics reflecting

              submissions, and finally, the cumulative time spent by players in
              clearing those tiers. This data offers a comprehensive look at the
              collective efforts and achievements of everyone involved during
              the season. If you're looking for more detailed insights, feel
