    q: `Purpose Of This Website?`,
    a: `To serves as an archive for Diablo 4 Season 5 pit runs, capturing the efforts of players striving for high pit clears. 
      
      A simple project created and currently maintained by one individual. If the project continue to grow through community contributions, will seek others who share a passion for the game and a commitment to record-keeping to join this volunteer effort.`,

    q: `How Does This Work?`,
    a: `Anyone interested in sharing their high pit clear can submit their run. They'll need to fill out a brief form about their runs, with the option to provide additional information. Once submitted, their entries will go through a "soft" validation to ensure the details are correct before being processed and posted on the website.
      
      The form is created using Google Forms, and the entries are stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. No information beyond what is included in the form is collected.`,

    q: `What Am I Looking At?`,
    a: `You are currently viewing a list of high pit clears organized by tier, with options to sort by different classes. Each entry also includes details of the skills used by the player. Clicking on the build or the build name will redirect you to the player's build planner and gameplay video, respectively. You can also click on the icons in the bottom right, which will redirect you to the same destinations.
    
    At this early stage, our goal is to compile a more substantial number of high clear pit runs. Once we have a sufficient amount, will look to creating more interesting sections.
    Sections may include individual pit clear history profiles, sorting by the fastest clear at specific pit tiers or ranges, accumulated highest pit tier clears across all classes, and etc.`,

    num: 4,
    q: `Should I Submit?`,
    a: `Pit clears above 100, repeated runs with improved times, and multiple submissions are all welcome. Every entry contributes to the development of future sections and every contribution counts, no matter how big or small.`,
