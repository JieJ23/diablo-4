    q: `What Is The Purpose Of This Website?`,
    a: `This website serves as an archive for Diablo 4 Season 5 pit runs, capturing the efforts of players striving for high pit clears. 
      
      This simple project created and currently maintained by one individual. If the project continue to grow through community contributions, we'll seek others who share a passion for the game and a commitment to record-keeping to join this volunteer effort.`,

    q: `How Does This Website Function?`,
    a: `Anyone interested in sharing their high pit clears can submit their run. They'll need to fill out a brief form about their runs, with the option to provide additional information. Once submitted, their entries will go through a "soft" validation to ensure the details are correct before being processed and posted on the website.
      
      The form is created using Google Forms, and the entries are stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. No information beyond what is included in the form is collected.`,

    q: `What Content Is Featured On This Website?`,
    a: `The current content features pit clears sorted by tier and classes; each entry displays the name of the build and the skills used. On the bottom right, you'll find links directing to the run's gameplay. If provided by the player, there will also be a link to the build planner.
    (Clicking on the build name will redirect you to the run's gameplay, and if available, clicking on the "build" will also redirect to the player's build planner.)
    
    At this early stage, our goal is to compile a substantial number of high clear pit runs, focusing on each class type. Once we have a sufficient amount, we'll review the data more thoroughly, creating interest sections the community would like to see.
    Sections may include individual pit clear history profiles, sorting by the fastest clear at specific pit tiers or ranges, accumulated highest pit tier clears across all classes, and etc.`,

    q: `Low Pit Clear/ Better Time/ More Runs; Should I Still Submit?`,
    a: `Pit clears above 100, repeated runs with improved times, and multiple submissions are all welcome. Every entry contributes to the development of future sections.`,
